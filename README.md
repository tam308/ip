# HorseBot
HorseBot is a CLI based task manager. Three types of tasks can be created: **Todo, Event and Deadline**. Tasks can then
be marked as **done**, **undone**, or **deleted**. Specific tasks can also be searched for using keywords.

HorseBot supports local data storage, and tasks will be saved and loaded automatically, even after the program is terminated.
